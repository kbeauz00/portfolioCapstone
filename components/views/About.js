            This recruiting app is built to increase your productivity. As a
            collegiate soccer coach, for the past 8 years, the recruiting
            planning has been the most difficult and laborious part of my job. I
            decided to create this app so i can enjoy talking and watching the
            best talent in the country. This app will allow you to search the
            players, that are in your data base, by simply typing the name of
            tournament.
