      This recruiting app is built to increase your productivity. <br> As a
      collegiate soccer coach, for the past 8 years, <br> the recruiting
      planning has been the most difficult and laborious part of my job. <br> I
      decided to create this app so i can enjoy talking and watching the
      best talent in the country. <br> This app will allow you to search the
      players, <br> that are in your data base, by simply typing the name of
      tournament.
