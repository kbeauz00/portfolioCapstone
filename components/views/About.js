      This registration and recruiting application is built to increase your overall productivity. <br> As a
      collegiate soccer coach, for the past 8 years, I have learned that a coach is only as good as his/her players. <br> I believe recruiting
      has been one of the most difficult and laborious parts of a coach's job. <br> This app will enable you to plan your next recruiting event efficiently in a very short time. It will allow you to register and search all the players for a specific tournament selected. I am dedicated to serve you and I want to help you recruit the best talent.
